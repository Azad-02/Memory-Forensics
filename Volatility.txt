VOLATILITY

Volatility is an open-source memory forensics toolkit written in Python. Volatility allows us to analyse memory dumps taken from Windows, Linux and Mac OS devices and is an extremely popular tool in memory forensics. 

For example, Volatility allows us to:

	List all processes that were running on the device at the time of the capture
	List active and closed network connections
	Use Yara rules to search for indicators of malware
	Retrieve hashed passwords, clipboard contents, and contents of the command prompt
	And much, much more!
